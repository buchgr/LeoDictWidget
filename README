Teaser:
Select a word and look it up in the LEO dictionary.

This extension allows you to select any word or text on a website and to look it up in the LEO dictionary (http://dict.leo.org) by simply pressing a keyboard shortcut or double clicking on the word (disabled by default, can be enabled in the options page).

The dictionary then pops up conveniently on the upper right corner inside your browser window. It does not open a new tab or window.
The dictionary can be hidden by simply pressing the keyboard shortcut again.

The shortcut defaults to ALT+Q, however you can set it to virtually any shortcut in the options page.

The language defaults to German - English, but can also be configured in the options page.

If you don't select a word or text, the dictionary will be opened with an empty search field and you can type in your query manually.

** NOTICE **
The default shortcut ALT+Q was not my smartest choice, since it does not work on Wikipedia. So if you want to use the extension on Wikipedia, I recommend to change the shortcut to something different (e.g. ALT+W). I can't however change the default shortcut, as a lot of people already use it.
