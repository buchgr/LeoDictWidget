Select a word on a website and immediately look up its translation on http://www.leo.org/!

This extension allows you to select a word or phrase on a website and to look it up in the LEO dictionary by simply pressing a keyboard shortcut. The dictionary pops up conveniently in the upper right corner inside your browser window. It does not open a new tab or window.

The shortcut defaults to Alt+W, however you can set it to virtually any shortcut in the options page. The language defaults to German - English and can also be configured in the options page.
